# HVST (Hackers Vulnerability Scanning Tools
This script is designed & built by **CryptoH4ck3r**. He built this program to provide some of the most basic tools required for vulnerability scanning and testing against our targets.  
He created this Bash script to create a simple user interface that will allow you to select what tool you want to use to scan your target.  
  
While this is still in beta-development stages, CryptoH4ck3r is aiming that this will help a lot of young hackers out there understand some of the tools utilized  
in hacking & penetration testing.

***PLEASE NOTE:*** *I, CryptoH4ck3r, am not responsible for any actions you do with this tool. The intended us of this tool is for security researches performing _Bug Bounty Programs_, _Server Administraton_, and _Educational Purposes_ only.*  
Any action you take with this tool will be strictly on you and I hold 0 (ZERO) accountablity for your actions!

## Intended Operatig System
At the time of creation, this tool is intended to work on virtually any Linux platform. However, due to the usage of some of the tools such as;  
* SQLMap  
* Nmap  
* Nikto  
etc.  
I highly recommend running this tool on either Kali Linux or Parrot OS as those operating systems already has these tools pre-installed. If you already have these  
tools installed on your Linux distro, you should be able to utilize this tool with ease.   
In due time, I will be working on a sub-menu section that will allow you to install the required tools for this program to work effeciently. However,  
I will be waiting to finish that off after I have added all of the tools I want to use in this program.
